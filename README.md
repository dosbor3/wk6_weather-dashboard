#  Weather Dashboard
A weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS

The weather dashboard allows a user to see the weather outlook for multiple cities to assist in trip planning.  The user will be provided with a weather dashboard with form inputs.  The user will be able to search for a city and be presented with current and future conditions for that city.  The searched city will be added to the search history.  When presented with the current weather conditions for that city the following will be displayed: 

*  The cityâ€™s name
*  The date
*  An icon representation of weather conditions
*  The temperature
*  The humidity
*  The wind speed
*  The UV index

When the user views the UV index, the user will be presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.  

When the user views the future weather conditions for that city, the user will be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.  

The user will be allowed to click on a city in the search history and be presented with current and future conditions for that city.
